# PWA Installation Debugging Checklist

## Requirements for PWA Installation

1. ✅ **HTTPS or localhost** - Required for service workers
2. ✅ **Valid manifest.json** - Generated by vite-plugin-pwa
3. ✅ **Service Worker** - Generated and registered
4. ✅ **Icons** - 192x192 and 512x512 PNG icons
5. ✅ **Display mode** - Set to "standalone"
6. ✅ **Start URL** - Set to "/"

## Current Status

- ✅ Service worker generated: `dist/sw.js`
- ✅ Manifest generated: `dist/manifest.webmanifest`
- ✅ Icons exist: `icon-192x192.png`, `icon-512x512.png`
- ✅ Service worker registration script: `dist/registerSW.js`

## Common Issues

1. **Not served over HTTPS** - PWAs require HTTPS (except localhost)
2. **Already installed** - Check if app is already installed
3. **Browser cache** - Clear browser cache and service workers
4. **Manifest errors** - Check browser console for manifest errors
5. **Service worker errors** - Check browser console for SW registration errors

## Testing Steps

1. Build the app: `npm run build`
2. Serve over HTTPS (or use localhost): `npm run preview` (localhost)
3. Open Chrome DevTools → Application → Manifest (check for errors)
4. Open Chrome DevTools → Application → Service Workers (check registration)
5. Check Chrome DevTools → Application → Installability (should show installable)

## Browser-Specific Notes

- **Chrome/Edge**: Should show install prompt automatically or via beforeinstallprompt event
- **Safari iOS**: Requires "Add to Home Screen" manually
- **Firefox**: May require manual installation
