# DigiGet 90-Second Demo Video Script

**Tone:** Casual, like showing a mate how it works. No corporate voiceover. Just straight talk.

**Equipment:** Film on your phone (portrait or landscape both work)

**Total Time:** ~90 seconds

---

## OPENING (5 seconds)

**[Screen: Show tablet/dashboard, point at it]**

"Alright, here's how DigiGet works. Three things you need to know."

---

## PART 1: STAFF CLOCK IN (20 seconds)

**[Screen: Show staff clock-in page on tablet]**

"First - staff clock in. Your barber taps in their 4-digit PIN. See that? Five seconds. Done."

**[Point at screen]**

"GPS checks they're actually here - not at home, not at the pub. If they're more than 50 metres away, it blocks them. Simple."

**[Tap/point to show location verification]**

"That's it. They're clocked in. You can see who's working right now on your dashboard."

---

## PART 2: CUSTOMER CHECK-IN (20 seconds)

**[Screen: Switch to customer check-in page]**

"Second thing - customer loyalty. Customer walks in, you type their phone number."

**[Type a phone number on screen]**

"Boom. They get a point. 10 visits equals free haircut. Takes literally 5 seconds."

**[Show points balance on screen]**

"They can see their balance on their phone. No cards to lose. No stamps. Just works."

---

## PART 3: PAYROLL REPORT (25 seconds)

**[Screen: Navigate to payroll/reports page]**

"Third thing - this is where you save 3 hours every week. End of the week, click 'Payroll Report'."

**[Tap on payroll button]**

"See? All your staff hours. Exactly who worked what. Automatic. No calculator, no paper."

**[Scroll through hours]**

"Click export to CSV. Send it to your accountant. Done. That's it."

**[Show CSV export/download]**

"10 minutes instead of 3 hours. Every single week."

---

## CLOSING (10 seconds)

**[Screen: Show dashboard overview or tablet close-up]**

"That's DigiGet. Track your staff properly. Keep customers coming back. Â£29 a month."

**[Show QR code or URL]**

"Start your free trial at digiget.uk. No credit card needed."

**[Fade out or show logo]**

"Cheers."

## TIPS FOR FILMING:

1. **Lighting:** Film in good natural light. Face a window if inside.

2. **Audio:** Speak clearly. If noisy, film in quieter spot or use phone's directional mic.

3. **Screen Recording:** You can also screen-record on your phone/tablet and add voiceover later.

4. **Keep It Casual:** If you stumble, just say "right, so..." and continue. Viewers prefer authentic over polished.

5. **Show Real Data:** Use actual numbers/hours if possible. Makes it feel real.

6. **Mobile View:** Film on the device barbers will actually use (tablet or phone).

7. **No Edits Needed:** Keep it raw. Single take is fine. Viewers trust that more.

## ALTERNATIVE: SCREEN RECORDING METHOD

If you prefer screen recording:

1. Record screen of tablet/phone showing the 3 demos
2. Add voiceover explaining each step
3. Keep voiceover conversational - like you're on a video call showing it

**Same script applies - just do it as voiceover while screen recording plays.**

---

## DELIVERY NOTES:

- **Pace:** Normal talking speed. Don't rush. Don't slow down dramatically.
- **Pauses:** Natural pauses are fine. "Right, so..." is good filler.
- **Errors:** If you tap wrong thing, just say "hold on" and fix it. Real is better.
- **Energy:** Friendly but professional. Like you're explaining to a barber mate.

## EXAMPLE OPENING (casual version):

"Right, so DigiGet. Three things you need to see. First..."

OR

"Alright mate, quick demo. Here's what it does..."

---

**Total runtime:** Aim for 60-90 seconds. Don't worry if it goes slightly over. Content is more important than perfect timing.
