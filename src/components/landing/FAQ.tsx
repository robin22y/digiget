  {
    question: "Why is it so cheap?",
    answer: "We only include features independent shops actually need. We don't add expensive features built for large chains that you'd never use."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to buy any hardware?",
    answer: "No. Works on any phone, tablet, or computer with a web browser."
  },
  {
    question: "Is there really a 90-day free trial?",
    answer: "Yes. Full access to everything. No card required to start. Only pay if you decide to keep it after 90 days."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I cancel anytime?",
    answer: "Yes. Cancel from your dashboard anytime. No contracts. No penalties."
  },
  {
    question: "What if I only have 1-2 staff?",
    answer: "Perfect. Â£9.99/month covers unlimited staff. Whether you have 1 or 10."
  },
  {
    question: "Do my customers need to download an app?",
    answer: "No. They just give their phone number at the till. That's it."
  },
  {
    question: "Does it work on iPhone/Android/iPad?",
    answer: "Yes. Works on any device with a web browser (Chrome, Safari, etc)."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens to my data if I cancel?",
    answer: "You can export all your data (customer info, staff hours, etc) before cancelling. We keep it for 30 days after cancellation, then permanently delete it."
  },
  {
    question: "Is my data secure?",
    answer: "Yes. Bank-level encryption. UK-based servers. GDPR compliant."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I upgrade from Basic to Pro later?",
    answer: "Yes. Upgrade or downgrade anytime from your dashboard."
